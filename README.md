# Advanced Parking Simulator

## Overview
The Advanced Parking Simulator is a project designed to simulate a parking system using Arduino and various sensors. This project demonstrates how to manage parking slots, detect vehicle presence, and provide visual and auditory feedback using LEDs and a buzzer.

## Features
- Real-time monitoring of parking slots.
- Visual indicators (LEDs) for available and occupied slots.
- Auditory alerts using a buzzer for specific conditions.
- User-friendly interface for interaction.

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have the following:
- Arduino IDE installed (version 1.8.0 or later).
- Compatible Arduino board (e.g., ATmega168, ATmega328, Teensy).
- TimerOne library installed.
- Ultrasonic sensor (e.g., HC-SR04) for vehicle detection.
- LEDs and a buzzer for feedback.

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install Arduino IDE
- Download and install the Arduino IDE from the [official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

### 2. Install TimerOne Library
- Open the Arduino IDE.
- Go to **Sketch** > **Include Library** > **Manage Libraries**.
- In the Library Manager, search for "TimerOne" and install it.

### 3. Clone or Download the Project
- Clone the repository using Git:
  git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/AdvancedParkingSimulator.git
Or download the ZIP file from the repository and extract it.
### 4. Open the Project in Arduino IDE
Open the Arduino IDE.
Go to File > Open and navigate to the project folder.
Open the main .ino file (e.g., AdvancedParkingSimulator.ino).
### Running the Project
1. Connect Your Arduino Board
Connect your Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.
2. Select the Board and Port
In the Arduino IDE, go to Tools > Board and select your Arduino model.
Go to Tools > Port and select the port your Arduino is connected to.
3. Upload the Code
Click the Upload button (right arrow icon) in the Arduino IDE to compile and upload the code to your board.
4. Monitor Output
Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (Tools > Serial Monitor) to view any output from the project.
